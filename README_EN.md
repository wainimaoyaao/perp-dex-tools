## Strategy Overview

**Important Notice**: Everyone must first understand the logic and risks of this script so you can set parameters that are more suitable for yourself, or you might think this is not a good strategy and don't want to use it at all. As I mentioned on Twitter, I didn't write these scripts for sharing purposes, but because I'm actually using this script myself, so I wrote it, and then shared it.
This script mainly focuses on long-term wear and tear. As long as the script continues to place orders, if the price reaches your highest trapped point after a month, then all your trading volume for that month will be zero-wear. Therefore, I believe that setting `--quantity` and `--wait-time` too small is not a good long-term strategy, but it is indeed suitable for short-term high-intensity volume trading. I usually use quantity between 40-60 and wait-time between 450-650 to ensure that even if the market goes against your judgment, the script can still place orders continuously and stably until the price returns to your entry point, achieving zero-wear volume trading.

The bot implements a simple trading strategy:

1. **Order Placement**: Places limit orders near the current market price
2. **Order Monitoring**: Waits for orders to be filled
3. **Close Order**: Automatically places close orders at the take-profit level
4. **Position Management**: Monitors positions and active orders
5. **Risk Management**: Limits maximum number of concurrent orders
6. **Grid Step Control**: Controls minimum price distance between new orders and existing close orders via `--grid-step` parameter
7. **Stop Trading Control**: Controls the price conditions for stopping transactions through the `--stop-price` parameter

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Parameters

- **quantity**: Trading amount per order
- **take-profit**: Take-profit percentage (e.g., 0.02 means 0.02%)
- **max-orders**: Maximum concurrent active orders (risk control)
- **wait-time**: Wait time between orders (prevents overtrading)
- **grid-step**: Grid step control (prevents close orders from being too dense)
- **stop-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', exit when price >= stop-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based termination)
- **pause-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', pause when price >= pause-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based pausing)

#### Grid Step Feature

The `--grid-step` parameter controls the minimum distance between new order close prices and existing close order prices:

- **Default -100**: No grid step restriction, executes original strategy
- **Positive value (e.g., 0.5)**: New order close price must maintain at least 0.5% distance from the nearest close order price
- **Purpose**: Prevents close orders from being too dense, improving fill probability and risk management

For example, when Long and `--grid-step 0.5`:

- If existing close order price is 2000 USDT
- New order close price must be lower than 1990 USDT (2000 √ó (1 - 0.5%))
- This prevents close orders from being too close together, improving overall strategy effectiveness

#### üìä Trading Flow Example

Assuming current ETH price is $2000 with take-profit set to 0.02%:

1. **Open Position**: Places buy order at $2000.40 (slightly above market price)
2. **Fill**: Order gets filled by the market, acquiring long position
3. **Close Position**: Immediately places sell order at $2000.80 (take-profit price)
4. **Complete**: Close order gets filled, earning 0.02% profit
5. **Repeat**: Continues to the next trading cycle

#### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

- **Order Limits**: Limits maximum concurrent orders via `max-orders`
- **Grid Control**: Ensures reasonable spacing between close orders via `grid-step`
- **Order Frequency Control**: Controls order timing via `wait-time` to prevent being trapped in short periods
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors positions and order status
- **Drawdown Monitoring**: Optional intelligent drawdown monitoring system with multi-level risk alerts and automatic stop-loss
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Basic Strategy No Stop Loss**: The basic strategy does not include stop-loss functionality, but risk management can be achieved through drawdown monitoring

#### üìà PnL and Margin Monitoring Features

The bot now supports real-time monitoring of account profit and loss (PnL) and margin status, providing comprehensive risk management:

##### üîç Monitoring Features

- **Account Balance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of available account balance
- **Account Equity Monitoring**: Monitor total account equity (including unrealized PnL)
- **Unrealized PnL Calculation**: Real-time calculation of unrealized PnL for all positions
- **Margin Usage Monitoring**: Monitor initial margin requirements
- **Position Loss Assessment**: Calculate potential losses of current positions

##### üéØ Supported Exchanges

Currently, PnL and margin monitoring features support the following exchanges:

- **Paradex**: Full support for all PnL and margin monitoring features
- **Other Exchanges**: Support is being gradually added

##### üìä Monitoring Data

The bot periodically records the following key metrics:

- **Account Balance**: Current funds available for trading
- **Account Equity**: Total account value (balance + unrealized PnL)
- **Unrealized PnL**: Floating profit/loss of all open positions
- **Initial Margin**: Margin required to maintain current positions
- **Position Loss**: Potential loss amount of current positions

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced Risk Management

- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Risk evaluation based on PnL data
- **Margin Monitoring**: Prevent forced liquidation due to insufficient margin
- **Loss Alerts**: Provide warnings when position losses exceed preset thresholds
- **Data Logging**: All PnL and margin data are recorded in logs

#### üìâ Drawdown Monitoring Feature

The bot now supports an intelligent drawdown monitoring system with multi-level risk alerts and automatic stop-loss functionality:

##### üéØ Monitoring Levels

- **Light Drawdown (default 5%)**: Send notification alerts, continue normal trading
- **Medium Drawdown (default 8%)**: Pause new orders, only allow closing positions
- **Severe Drawdown (default 12%)**: Immediately stop all trading, trigger automatic stop-loss

##### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters

- `--enable-drawdown-monitor`: Enable drawdown monitoring feature
- `--drawdown-light-threshold`: Light drawdown threshold (default 5.0%)
- `--drawdown-medium-threshold`: Medium drawdown threshold (default 8.0%)
- `--drawdown-severe-threshold`: Severe drawdown threshold (default 12.0%)

##### üîÑ How It Works

1. **Session Initialization**: Record initial net worth as baseline when trading starts
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously get account net worth, calculate drawdown percentage relative to session peak
3. **Smart Smoothing**: Use moving average algorithm to reduce false alarms from net worth fluctuations
4. **Tiered Response**: Take different risk management measures based on drawdown severity
5. **Auto Recovery**: Automatically resume normal trading when drawdown level decreases

##### üìä Monitoring Data

- **Session Peak Net Worth**: Highest net worth achieved during the trading session
- **Current Net Worth**: Real-time account net worth
- **Drawdown Percentage**: (Peak Net Worth - Current Net Worth) / Peak Net Worth √ó 100%
- **Smoothed Net Worth**: Net worth processed with moving average to reduce noise

##### üö® Enhanced Risk Management

- **Real-time Notifications**: Send drawdown alerts via Telegram/Lark
- **Automatic Stop-loss**: Automatically stop trading during severe drawdowns
- **Progressive Response**: Take different measures based on drawdown severity
- **Session Reset**: Recalculate baseline net worth each time trading starts
