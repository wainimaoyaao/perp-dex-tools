## Multi-Exchange Trading Bot

A modular trading bot that supports multiple exchanges including EdgeX, Backpack, Paradex, Aster, Lighter, and GRVT. The bot implements an automated strategy that places orders and automatically closes them at a profit.



## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd perp-dex-tools
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**:

   First, make sure you are not currently in any virtual environment:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

   Create virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

   Activate virtual environment (you need to activate the virtual environment every time you use the script):

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   First, make sure you are not currently in any virtual environment:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

   Activate virtual environment (you need to activate the virtual environment every time you use the script):

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Paradex Users**: If you want to use Paradex exchange, you need to create an additional virtual environment and install Paradex-specific dependencies:

   First, make sure you are not currently in any virtual environment:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

   Create a dedicated virtual environment for Paradex (named para_env):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv para_env
   ```

   Activate virtual environment (you need to activate the virtual environment every time you use the script):

   ```bash
   source para_env/bin/activate  # Windows: para_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Install Paradex dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r para_requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and use env_example.txt as a template to modify with your API keys.

5. **Telegram Bot Setup (Optional)**:
   To receive trading notifications, please refer to the [Telegram Bot Setup Guide](docs/telegram-bot-setup-en.md) to configure your Telegram bot.

## Strategy Overview

**Important Notice**: Everyone must first understand the logic and risks of this script so you can set parameters that are more suitable for yourself, or you might think this is not a good strategy and don't want to use it at all. As I mentioned on Twitter, I didn't write these scripts for sharing purposes, but because I'm actually using this script myself, so I wrote it, and then shared it.
This script mainly focuses on long-term wear and tear. As long as the script continues to place orders, if the price reaches your highest trapped point after a month, then all your trading volume for that month will be zero-wear. Therefore, I believe that setting `--quantity` and `--wait-time` too small is not a good long-term strategy, but it is indeed suitable for short-term high-intensity volume trading. I usually use quantity between 40-60 and wait-time between 450-650 to ensure that even if the market goes against your judgment, the script can still place orders continuously and stably until the price returns to your entry point, achieving zero-wear volume trading.

The bot implements a simple trading strategy:

1. **Order Placement**: Places limit orders near the current market price
2. **Order Monitoring**: Waits for orders to be filled
3. **Close Order**: Automatically places close orders at the take-profit level
4. **Position Management**: Monitors positions and active orders
5. **Risk Management**: Limits maximum number of concurrent orders
6. **Grid Step Control**: Controls minimum price distance between new orders and existing close orders via `--grid-step` parameter
7. **Stop Trading Control**: Controls the price conditions for stopping transactions through the `--stop-price` parameter

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Parameters

- **quantity**: Trading amount per order
- **take-profit**: Take-profit percentage (e.g., 0.02 means 0.02%)
- **max-orders**: Maximum concurrent active orders (risk control)
- **wait-time**: Wait time between orders (prevents overtrading)
- **grid-step**: Grid step control (prevents close orders from being too dense)
- **stop-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', exit when price >= stop-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based termination)
- **pause-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', pause when price >= pause-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based pausing)

#### Grid Step Feature

The `--grid-step` parameter controls the minimum distance between new order close prices and existing close order prices:

- **Default -100**: No grid step restriction, executes original strategy
- **Positive value (e.g., 0.5)**: New order close price must maintain at least 0.5% distance from the nearest close order price
- **Purpose**: Prevents close orders from being too dense, improving fill probability and risk management

For example, when Long and `--grid-step 0.5`:

- If existing close order price is 2000 USDT
- New order close price must be lower than 1990 USDT (2000 √ó (1 - 0.5%))
- This prevents close orders from being too close together, improving overall strategy effectiveness

#### üìä Trading Flow Example

Assuming current ETH price is $2000 with take-profit set to 0.02%:

1. **Open Position**: Places buy order at $2000.40 (slightly above market price)
2. **Fill**: Order gets filled by the market, acquiring long position
3. **Close Position**: Immediately places sell order at $2000.80 (take-profit price)
4. **Complete**: Close order gets filled, earning 0.02% profit
5. **Repeat**: Continues to the next trading cycle

#### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

- **Order Limits**: Limits maximum concurrent orders via `max-orders`
- **Grid Control**: Ensures reasonable spacing between close orders via `grid-step`
- **Order Frequency Control**: Controls order timing via `wait-time` to prevent being trapped in short periods
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors positions and order status
- **‚ö†Ô∏è No Stop Loss**: This strategy does not include stop-loss functionality and may face significant losses in adverse market conditions

#### üìà PnL and Margin Monitoring Features

The bot now supports real-time monitoring of account profit and loss (PnL) and margin status, providing comprehensive risk management:

##### üîç Monitoring Features

- **Account Balance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of available account balance
- **Account Equity Monitoring**: Monitor total account equity (including unrealized PnL)
- **Unrealized PnL Calculation**: Real-time calculation of unrealized PnL for all positions

##### üéØ Supported Exchanges

Currently, PnL and margin monitoring features support the following exchanges:

- **Paradex**: Full support for all PnL and margin monitoring features
- **Other Exchanges**: Support is being gradually added

##### üìä Monitoring Data

The bot periodically records the following key metrics:

- **Account Balance**: Current funds available for trading
- **Account Equity**: Total account value (balance + unrealized PnL)
- **Unrealized PnL**: Floating profit/loss of all open positions
- **Initial Margin**: Margin required to maintain current positions
- **Position Loss**: Potential loss amount of current positions

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced Risk Management

- **Margin Monitoring**: Prevent forced liquidation due to insufficient margin
- **Loss Alerts**: Provide warnings when position losses exceed preset thresholds
- **Data Logging**: All PnL and margin data are recorded in logs

## Q & A

### How to configure multiple accounts for the same exchange on the same device?

1. Create a .env file for each account, such as account_1.env, account_2.env
2. Set `ACCOUNT_NAME=` in each account's .env file, such as `ACCOUNT_NAME=MAIN`.
3. Configure the API keys or secrets for each account in each file
4. Use different `--env-file` parameters in the command line to start different accounts, such as `python runbot.py --env-file account_1.env [other parameters...]`

### How to configure multiple accounts for different exchanges on the same device?

Configure all different exchange accounts in the same `.env` file, then use different `--exchange` parameters in the command line to start different exchanges, such as `python runbot.py --exchange backpack [other parameters...]`

### How to configure multiple contracts for the same account and exchange on the same device?

Configure the account in the `.env` file, then use different `--ticker` parameters in the command line to start different contracts, such as `python runbot.py --ticker ETH [other parameters...]`
